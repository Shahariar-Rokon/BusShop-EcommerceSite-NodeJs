# BusShop-EcommerceSite using NodeJS, HTML and C# 


## Description

This project is created to demonstrate **EcommerceSite** using ** NodeJS, HTML and C# **. 
In this project I created a hypothetical ecommerce site wher you can buy **Korean** buses.

In this project, I've created a hypothetical scenario about a software where you can:

- Buy buses.
- Add multiple products to the customer's cart.
- Use admin panel for inserting new items.
- New item may include picture and price.
- Total price for the cart and so on.
This project is intended to showcase the features and capabilities of EcommerceSite which uses NodeJS. Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback or contributions.
